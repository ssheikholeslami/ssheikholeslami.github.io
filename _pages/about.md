Hi there! Iâ€™m Sina Sheikholeslami, and I do research in machine learning systems and applications of machine learning and deep learning in various domains.

I did my PhD studies in the Distributed Computing Group of the Division of Software and Computer Systems (SCS), EECS School of KTH, where I was advised by Vladimir Vlassov, Amir Payberah, and Jim Dowling. My main interest lies in the intersection of distributed systems, machine learning/deep learning, and data-intensive computing, as well as applications of ML/DL in different domains. I have a particular interest in finding (relatively) simple yet sound and practical solutions to challenging questions in machine learning, deep learning, and scalable computing. I also strongly believe in open science and reproducible research, and to that end all of my own work is publicly available with ready-to-execute scripts for reproducing the results.
